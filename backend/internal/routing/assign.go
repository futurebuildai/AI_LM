// capacity descending (ties by ID); stops by weight descending (ties by
// OrderID). Each stop is placed in the first load with enough remaining
// capacity; stops that fit no vehicle are returned as unassigned. Loads that
// end up empty are dropped. This is the swappable optimizer seam — a real CVRP
