// Package auth implements AI_LM staff login (COMM-1 pillar 4). A staff member
// authenticates with their GableLBM email; AI_LM checks entitlement against
// GableLBM's /api/integration/validate-staff endpoint and, on success, mints a
// short-lived HMAC-signed AI_LM session JWT that pkg/middleware verifies with
// SESSION_SECRET. AI_LM never stores staff credentials — GableLBM remains the
// identity source of truth.
